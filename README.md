# 🔍 Phishing Detection System (ML + GUI)

This project is a **Phishing Detection System** built with **Python, Machine Learning, and Tkinter GUI**.  
It allows everyday users to check if a URL is **Safe ✅** or a potential **Phishing ⚠️** attempt using a user-friendly desktop application.

---

## ✨ Features
- Detects phishing links based on:
  - **URL lexical features** (length, `@`, `-`, HTTPS usage, IP-based domains)
  - **Suspicious keywords** in email subject/body (e.g., *verify your account, urgent, password reset*)
  - **TF-IDF text analysis**
- Trained with **Random Forest Classifier**
- Saves and loads trained ML models (`phishing_model.pkl`)
- **Simple GUI (Tkinter)** for checking links without coding knowledge

## ⚡ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muzammil12204/Phishing-Detection-System.git
   cd Phishing-Detection-System


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the application:

python phishing_app.py


Using the GUI:

Enter a URL in the text box

Click Check Link

Get instant results:

✅ Safe or ⚠️ Phishing

Confidence score

Reasons (if detected as suspicious)

📊 Dataset Format

If you want to train your own model, prepare a CSV (phishing_data.csv) with columns:

url,email_subject,email_body,label
http://malicious.example,Please verify your account,Click here to verify,1
https://legit.example,Your invoice,Please find attached invoice,0


label = 1 → phishing

label = 0 → safe

🚀 Packaging as EXE (Windows)

To create a standalone .exe (no Python needed for end users):

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile phishing_app.py


The executable will be available in the dist/ folder.

🔮 Future Improvements

Deploy as a web app (Flask/Streamlit)

Add WHOIS/domain age features

Integrate with VirusTotal API for URL reputation

Improve dataset with real-world phishing samples
